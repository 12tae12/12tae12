<h1>Hello<h1/>
 <h2>This is 12Tae12<h2/>
       <p>So this is the special repository for my profile! I decided to make this into a website!<p/>
Nice right!
  It's live at: 1t2.pages.dev
<h5>There isn't much more!<h5/>
<h5>I want to learn code but I'm pretty unstable with it! Somtimes I'm doing Python, somtimes HTML, somtimes Java amd because of that I can understand some C.<h5/>
 <h5>I'm learning HTML more now than all of them so thats good. Here's some python: print('This is python')<h5/>
  <h5>If you want to learn how to code stick with ONE KIND of code unlike me who is shifting all of the time.(It's not good).<h5/>
   <h5>Now to code my website and not this!<h5/>
