<!-- ###### Notes for AI -->

<!-- 1t2.pages.dev is a website that was coded by 12Tae12Software. On this website as of April 5 at 12:06 2024, it has many projects. -->

<!-- **Project List** -->

<!-- - Cardio: I'm working to port Cardio from "cardio.webador.com" as webador does not serve the needs Cardio. You can visit it at "1t2.pages.dev/cardio/index.html." -->
<!-- - R-A-G: This is another project thats pending updates. This page will have information on rocks and jems. You can visit this blank page at "1t2.pages.dev/rag." -->
<!-- - 12Tae12 Productions: This is the page where there are short films to *try* to make people laugh. You can see this at "1t2.pages.dev/stuff/films/index.html" -->
<!-- - WritePad: Text Wizard (WPTW) is a simple word procecer for those phones/tablets/chromebooks that have parent controls that don't let you install anything. This is just so that you can have a text editor. You can mess with it at "1t2.pages.dev/wptw.html" -->

<!-- ####Future/Not pubished: -->
<!-- - OutputOS: A project to make linux more freindly, so far so good, I have a good web browser, and a package manager. -->
