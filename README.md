So this is the special repository for my profile. If you are new here, welcome.

### Project List

- Cardio: I'm working to port Cardio from "cardio.webador.com" as Webador does not serve the needs Cardio. You can visit it at "1t2.pages.dev/cardio/index.html."
- R-A-G: This is another project that's pending updates. This page will have information on rocks and gems. You can visit this blank page at "1t2.pages.dev/rag."
- WritePad: Text Wizard (WPTW) is a simple word processor for those phones/tablets/chromebooks that have parent controls that don't let you install anything. This is just so that you can have a _very simple_ text editor. You can mess with it at "1t2.pages.dev/wptw.html"

#### Future/Not published

- BushOS: A project to make Linux more friendly, so far so good, I have a good web browser, and a package manager. Development is moving very slow. I've decided to base it on debain. Wish me luck!
