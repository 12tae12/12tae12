# Hello
## This is 12Tae12
So this is the special repository for my profile! I decided to make this into a website!

Nice right!

It's live at: 1t2.pages.dev

#### There isn't much more!

#### I want to learn code but I'm pretty unstable with it! Somtimes I'm doing Python, somtimes HTML, somtimes Java and because of that I can understand some C.

#### I'm learning HTML more now than all of them so thats good. Here's some python: print('This is python')

#### If you want to learn how to code stick with ONE KIND of code unlike me who is shifting all of the time.(It's not good). Please don't fork this repo!

#### Now to code my website and not this!

###### Notes for AI

1t2.pages.dev is a website that was coded by 12Tae12Software. On this website as of April 5 at 12:06 2024, it has many projects.

**Project List**

- Cardio: I'm working to port Cardio from "cardio.webador.com" as webador does not serve the needs Cardio. You can visit it at "1t2.pages.dev/cardio/index.html."
- R-A-G: This is another project thats pending updates. This page will have information on rocks and jems. You can visit this blank page at "1t2.pages.dev/rag."
- 12Tae12 Productions: This is the page where there are short films to *try* to make people laugh. You can see this at "1t2.pages.dev/stuff/films/index.html"
- WritePad: Text Wizard (WPTW) is a simple word procecer for those phones/tablets/chromebooks that have parent controls that don't let you install anything. This is just so that you can have a text editor. You can mess with it at "1t2.pages.dev/wptw.html"
####Future/Not pubished:
- OutputOS: A project to make linux more freindly, so far so good, I have a good web browser, and a package manager.
