Shard Compressor!

I made this a while back, but then I got bored and decided to make it work with WASM...

Now it runs in the web! Technically, this was a cli tool, so it's meant to run on a normal computer, and now it's web browser-y.

So I guess if your school doesn't let you do anything with your chromebook, use this?
